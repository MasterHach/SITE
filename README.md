# SITE
simple html site with non-using data store, but quite pretty in design

i use django as fraimwork to run my site
what else...

the command for run the server is 'python manage.py runserver'

so, all dependencies are in requirements.txt

and my site will expands with time, but now it is simply html-css-and-some-js web-page

and you can enjoy being alone on it, read some quotes and at all enjoy peace and quiete...

in the future i want to realize database, make pasrser of qoutes and add other html pages
